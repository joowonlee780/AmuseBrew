in all its animable objects EVER made also for small companies and the single user

We coming from an experience of over 15 years in the creation of videogames having worked 
for several prestigious software houses 

We want to give you the opportunity (at a relatively low price) to be able to make

videogames industries which invest millions of dollars in the creation of fully animable 
characters with a high graphic standard.

you are looking for with a minimal expense.
